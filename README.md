WHAT DOES THIS PYTHON APP DO?

It is a fitness tracker app that allows friends to create/join each others groups so that they may post their 3 most recent exercises, the weight of those exercises, 
and their current bodyweight, so that they can stay up-to-date with each others workouts.

-- KEY FEATURES --

It allows for the creation of a user, and for that user to log in.

After the user logs in, they can choose to create or join a group. - You can join or create an infinite amount of groups.

After joining a group, you can go to that groups page, and see the entries made by that group.
- Here, you can create your own entries, and those entries will only be seen by that group.

Additional features include...

A plate calculator, given that the exercise is a barbell exercise.
